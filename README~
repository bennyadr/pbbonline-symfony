# PBB Online

PBB Online is an integrated Land and Building Tax system crafted in [Symfony 1.8](http://symfony.com/).

## Quick Start

Fork this project and clone it to your local machine.

	$ git clone https://github.com/<your git name>/zlog-symfony .

This will work "out of the box", provided that you clone the repository under the root web directory configured for your server (apache2 is in '/var/web/' by default).

After cloning, test the sandbox by requesting the following URL:

    http://localhost/pbbonline/web/
    
You should see a pbbonline page.
